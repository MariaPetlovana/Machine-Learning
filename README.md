# Machine Learning
Project is created to indicate kind of nurses activity at each period of work day. Taught and based on information about tracked nurses activities during the working day. 

The main goal of this project is to determine activity periods during the day and as consequence - optimize working activities of nurses according to the period of day (morning, noon, evening). Optimization is topical for both: patients - to get more appropriate treatment, and hospitals - to plan resources and time usage in more accurate way.
